# Codes of the paper "An adaptively inexact first-order method for bilevel optimization with application to hyperparameter learning"
This repository includes the codes of the algorithm Method of Adaptive Inexact Descent (MAID) for bilevel learning. This Algorithm solves bilevel problems with adaptive inexactness and finds suitable upper-level step sizes by its builtin line search.
